# Common Issues

1. Annotate a new SE over an event annotation > Not necessary TODO make clear in guidelines
  - [a performance [gap]{_event} of 60 percent has opened in this year](sentiment) > wrong, not necessary
2. Target is almost always the company that is affected by the sentiment expression. Often I see that the subject of the sentence is annotated, but not the company that is affected by the sentiment. Always ask yourself: what company does this sentiment expression affect the most???
3. Annotating too many words: often you do not need to include verbs and auxiliary verbs a lot: try to really minimize event annotation.
4. Ignoring sentences without pre-existing annotations:
5. Speed: annotate a little faster.

## Common issues and difficult cases encountered during annotation testing.

- Annotate a new SE over an event annotation > Not necessary TODO make clear in guidelines
  - jefdhondt: aal08 s01 s02 s03 s04 s05 s012 s18 s20 : TODO point this out to him.
  - jefdhondt: aal09 aal10
  - a performance [gap]_event of 60 percent has opened in this year
- Polarity decision: Disconnect between event meaning and context in sentence: TODO 
  - jefdhondt: aal08 s03: imperil (...) the [new]{_event: neutral} Chicago-Dusseldorf route.
- Negation scope rule: TODO remind annotators
  - jefdhondt: aal08 s04: 
- Annotating too many words: includes verbs and auxiliary verbs a lot
 - jefdhondt: aal09 s02: includes auxiliary verb and too many arguments: TODO ask him to make them smaller
 - 
- Annotate new events as targets > wrong only annotate entities as new targets.
  - jef: aal10: 
  - 
- Target is almost always the company that is affected by the sentiment expression not anything else:
  - e.g. haiyanaapl [China is a problem] for Apple: Apple is target not China: The question you should ask is WHO IS MORE AFFECTED BY THE OPINION?
  - 
 - Ignore sentences without annotations: especially Haiyan: you skip sentences that don't have annotations.
 
Highlight today:
- Do not annotate new sentiment expression on top of event
- Do not

## personal working points:
- Jef
  - You are good at identifying all relevant sentiment expressions so definitely keep that up. 
  - Annotating too many words: includes verbs and auxiliary verbs a lot
  - Polarity decision: Disconnect between event meaning and context in sentence: TODO 
  - jefdhondt: aal08 s03: imperil (...) the [new]{_event: neutral} Chicago-Dusseldorf route.

  - Annotate a new SE over an event annotation
  - Annotate new events as targets

- Haiyan:
  - Selecting targets is an issue.
  - Selecting
  
  - You are very good at choosing the amount of words.
  - Skipping sentiment expressions is an issue
  -
